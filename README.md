# 8-Puzzle Solver :game_die:
Created this project for my Artificial Intelligence course.
The puzzle consists of an area divided into a grid, 3 by 3 for the 8-puzzle. On each grid
square is a tile, expect for one square which remains empty. Thus, there are eight tiles in
the 8-puzzle. A tile that is next to the empty grid square can be moved into the empty space,
leaving its previous position empty in turn. Tiles are numbered, 1 through 8 for the 8-puzzle, so
that each tile can be uniquely identified.
